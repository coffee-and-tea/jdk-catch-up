### Not all of changes will be studied in details, only priority ones will be studied in this project. 
### Here's the notes and reasoning for the selection:

| JSR     | Selection  | Reason                                                                   |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| JSR 203 | Picked     | Catch up on  New IO package                                              |
| JSR 292 | Not picked | Prep work for lambda express, will catch up lambda express later         |
| JSR 334 | Picked     | String in switch, try with resources and other improvements              |
| JSR 260 | Not picked | JSR withdraw                                                             |
| JSR 295 | Not picked | JSR withdraw                                                             |
| JSR 296 | Not picked | JSR withdraw                                                             |
| JSR 305 | Not picked | JSR dormant                                                              |
| JSR 308 | Picked*    | Annotations on Java Types, together with JSR 269 catch up annotation, need to decide how to organize learning project structure for one topic |
| JSR 310 | Picked     | Improved Date and Time API features                                      | 
| JSR 901 | Not picked | JSR for maintenance                                                      |
| JSR 924 | Not picked | JSR for maintenance                                                      |
| JSR 199 | Not picked | JSR for maintenance                                                      |
| JSR 206 | Not picked | JSR withdraw                                                             |
| JSR 222 | Not picked | Java SE 11 removed JAXB, obsolete module                                 |
| JSR 224 | Not picked | Java SE 11 removed JAX-WS module, considering this as Java EE learning path | 
| JSR 269 | Picked     | Even though annotation is introduced with Java SE 5, it's a major language improvement, probably @Test is the most used annotation that I could think of. It's good playground to understand reflection, also different retention and target for annotation. |
| Other   | Not picked | Features not including major language changes                            |
